# Credit-Card-Defaulting-Prediction

Financial institutions have the mandate of approving or denying credit applications from customers, and a couple of conditions would be considered before making such decision. This mini-project aims at predicting customer patterns that could lead in denial of credit applications by analyzing credit card data obtained from `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients`. 

Some of the Machine Learning techniques applied include XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Pipelines, Hyperparameter optimization, Feature Selection and model interpretation using Eli5. Attempts were made to balance true positive predictions with accuracy, and in the end, 82% accuracy was recorded using XGBoost method.
